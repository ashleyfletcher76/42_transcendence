Chat Application Readme

Welcome to the Chat Application! This application provides a simple yet powerful messaging platform where you can communicate with other users in three distinct ways: Direct Messages (Whispers), Tournament Group Messages, and General Chat Messages.
Features

    Direct Messaging (Whisper)
    Send a private message directly to another user using the /user command. Only the specified user will see the message.

    Tournament Group Messaging
    Share messages with the members of the tournament group using the /tournament command. Messages sent in this mode will be visible to everyone in the tournament group.

    General Chat Messaging
    Send a message to all users in the chat without using any command. This is the default communication mode.

How to Use
Commands

/username message

    Replace username with the recipient's username.
    Replace message with your desired text.

    This will send "Hello everyone!" to all connected users.

Filters

You can filter chat messages based on their type:
