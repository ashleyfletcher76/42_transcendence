To create a live chat for a game with the functionalities you described—whispering to someone, writing in a group, or sending messages in a lobby where everyone can see—you can use a single WebSocket connection, but you will need to manage different types of messages and rooms within that connection. Here's a basic outline:

Single WebSocket Connection:

Use one WebSocket connection per user to handle all types of messages.
Message Types:

Whisper (private message): Messages sent directly from one user to another.
Group Chat: Messages sent to a specific group of users that have joined a particular chat room.
Lobby Chat: Messages sent to the main lobby where everyone can see them.
Managing Rooms:

Implement different chat rooms on the server-side logic.
Use tags or message headers to indicate the type of message and the target audience.
Here's a conceptual example in pseudo-code:

Server-Side:

on message received (ws, message):
    if message.type == 'whisper':
        target_user = findUserByUsername(message.target)
        sendMessage(target_user, message.content)
    elif message.type == 'group':
        target_group = findGroupByName(message.target)
        sendMessageToGroup(target_group, message.content)
    elif message.type == 'lobby':
        sendMessageToAllUsers(message.content)

on connect (ws):
    addUserToLobby(ws)

on disconnect (ws):
    removeUserFromAllGroups(ws)
    removeUserFromLobby(ws)

Client-Side:

function sendMessage(type, target, content) {
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({
        type: type,
        target: target,
        content: content
    }))
}

// To whisper
sendMessage('whisper', 'username', 'Hello, this is a whisper message.')

// To group chat
sendMessage('group', 'groupName', 'Hello, this is a group message.')

// To lobby chat
sendMessage('lobby', null, 'Hello, this is a lobby message.')

In this setup, the WebSocket connection handles different types of messages distinguished by their type and target fields. The server processes these messages accordingly, routing whispers directly to users, group messages to specific groups, and lobby messages to all connected users.
