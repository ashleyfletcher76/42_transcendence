Userprofile:
profile.json
{
    username: "username",
    nickname: "nickname",
    avatar: "picture",
    status: "online",
    wins: "12",
    losses: "11",
    games: "23",
    trophies: "1",
    friends: [friends_list] (use usernames for friendslist i use the nickname in the frontend for everything so in the backend we need a function like get_username_by_nickname(nickname))
    blocks: [blocked_list],
    ...(add everything you want)
}


API Userservice:

-Endpoint to get all userprofiles (nickname, status and trophies is enough)

-Enpoint to get userprofile by nickname (response should be previous defined profile.json)

-Endpoint to update Nickname and Avatar (tbd)

-update endpoint for add_friend (both users should get added as friends by each other with one call.)
    request is { user1: "user", user2: "player", type: "add/remove"} --> add/remove player as friend of user and add/remove user as friend of player.

same logic for block_user
    request is { user1: "user", user2: "player", type: "add/remove"} --> add/remove player from/to blocklist of user and add/remove user from/to blocklist of player.


Torunament-Chat-Interaction:

The Tournamentsystem should create a group in the chatservice if a new tournament get created.
Everytime a new user joins the tournament it should get add to the chatgroup. The chatgroup should have the name of the tournament.
If a user leaves the tournament he get removed from the chatgroup. if the tournament get closed the chat group also need to be closed.
The Tournament Service should be able to send messages in this chatgroup for launching/warning the next matches.
