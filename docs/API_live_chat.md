# Chat Service API Documentation

## Overview
The `chat-service` enables real-time messaging between users through WebSockets. It supports creating and joining chat rooms and facilitates seamless communication. The service is built using Django Channels, with Redis for real-time messaging and PostgreSQL for database management. This document outlines the current state of the service, available APIs, and frontend integration guidelines.

## WebSocket Endpoints

### Connect to a Chat Room
**WebSocket URL**: `wss://<your-domain>/ws/chat/{room_name}/`

To connect to a chat room, establish a WebSocket connection to the above URL, replacing `{room_name}` with the name of the room.

- **Example**:
```bash
  wscat -c wss://localhost:10443/ws/chat/my_room/ --no-check
```
* Behavior:
- On a successful connection, users can send and receive messages in real time.
- If the room does not exist or the user is unauthorized, the connection will fail.

### Send and Receive Messages

Once connected to a WebSocket room:

* To send a message:
```json
{
  "message": "Your message here"
}
```

* To receive messages:

- The server broadcasts messages sent by other users in the room:
```json
{
  "message": "Message from another user"
}
```

## Using wscat for Testing
Connecting to a Chat Room

To connect to a chat room using wscat:
```bash
wscat -c wss://localhost:10443/ws/chat/{room_name}/ --no-check
```

Replace {room_name} with the desired room name.
Sending a Message

After establishing a WebSocket connection, send a message in JSON format:
```json
{
  "message": "Hello, World!"
}
```
Receiving Messages

Messages sent by other users in the room will automatically be broadcast to all connected clients.
