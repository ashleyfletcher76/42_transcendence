This are the JSON format i send to the chat-backend-service. As a response i want the exact same format back with the exact same content, so you just route the message to the right user/users. 
The interpretation of the message take plase in the frontend. 

"Whisper", "add" and "invite" types get only send to the user defiened in the "to" section. Type "all" get send to all users. 
Type "tournament" get send to all users in the Tournament (Please define a way to get the users from the tournament with @muhakose (i can provide the tournament name in the "to" section)).

All Messages should additionally get send back to the sender. So for a whisper message it get send to the user in the "to" section and to the user in the "from" section etc...
