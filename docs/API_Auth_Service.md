## API Documentation for Authentication Service

## Summary:

The authentication service handles user authentication, token issuance, and user logout. It uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to validate usersâ€™ identities across microservices. This service is pivotal in enforcing secure access control through token-based authentication.

Each microservice has its own PostgreSQL database to enhance data separation and security. The authentication service connects to its own auth-db container for managing authentication data independently. This modular approach keeps each service isolated, ensuring better scalability and security.

Note: The backend only works with HTTP between services, but NGINX manages external threats and enforces HTTPS for requests reaching the services from outside. In development, if using self-signed certificates with NGINX, you may need to disable certificate verification when testing with tools like curl.

## Authentication Flow

The authentication service utilizes JWT to manage user sessions. Users authenticate using credentials, and the service issues a token. This token must be included in the Authorization header for accessing protected endpoints across the application.

## HTTPS Endpoints
1. User Login

Description: Authenticates a user by their username and password and returns a JWT token pair (access and refresh tokens).

```plaintext
POST http://localhost:8000/auth/login/
```

- Request Payload:

```plaintext
{
	"username": "your_username",
	"password": "your_password"
}
```

- Response:

```plaintext
{
	"refresh": "your_refresh_token",
	"access": "your_access_token"
}
```

- Error Response: If the credentials are invalid, you will get a 401 Unauthorized error.

```plaintext
{
	"detail": "No active account found with the given credentials"
}
```

2. Refresh Token

Description: Refreshes the access token by providing the valid refresh token, extending the user's session without requiring them to log in again.

```plaintext
POST http://localhost:8000/auth/token/refresh/
```

- Request Payload:

```plaintext
{
	"refresh": "your_refresh_token"
}
```

- Response:

```plaintext
{
	"access": "new_access_token"
}
```

- Error Response: If the refresh token is expired or invalid, you will receive a 401 Unauthorized error.

3. Validate Token

Description: Validates the access token by checking it against the user-service to confirm user existence.

```bash
POST http://localhost:8000/auth/validate-token/
```

Request Header:

Authorization: Bearer your_access_token

Response (If token is valid and user exists):

```json
{
    "detail": "Token is valid"
}
```

Error Responses:

- User not found:
```json
{
    "error": "User not found"
}
```
- Invalid or expired token:

```json
{
    "detail": "Invalid or expired token"
}
```

4. User Logout

Description: Logs out the user by blacklisting the provided refresh token, invalidating it for future use.

```plaintext
POST http://localhost:8000/auth/logout/
```

- Request Payload:

```plaintext
{
	"refresh_token": "your_refresh_token"
}
```

- Response:

```plaintext
{
	"message": "Logged out successfully"
}
```

- Error Response: If the token is already blacklisted or invalid, the server responds with an error.

```plaintext
{
	"error": "Token is invalid or already blacklisted"
}
```

## JWT Token Usage

1. Access Token: This is a short-lived token used to authenticate requests. It is sent in the Authorization header in the following format:

```plaintext
Authorization: Bearer your_access_token
```

2. Refresh Token: This is a long-lived token used to refresh the access token once it expires. It should be securely stored and only sent when refreshing the access token.

## Error Codes

- 401 Unauthorized: If authentication fails due to invalid credentials or an invalid/expired token.
- 400 Bad Request: If the request body is not properly formatted or is missing required fields.

## Summary for Frontend:

* Login Flow: Use /auth/login/ to obtain access and refresh tokens upon user login.
* Token Management: The frontend should store the tokens (e.g., in localStorage or sessionStorage) and send the access token in the Authorization header for all authenticated API requests.
* Token Refresh: Use /auth/token/refresh/ to refresh the access token before it expires, keeping the user session active without requiring them to log in again.
* Logout Flow: Call /auth/logout/ and send the refresh token to ensure the user is logged out and their session invalidated.

- Security Note: Ensure all user-facing requests are HTTPS-secured through NGINX, even though backend services communicate over HTTP. Store JWT tokens securely to prevent unauthorized access.
