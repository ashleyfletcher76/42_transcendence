## ISSUES FOUND TODAY

* Auto login doesn't work. It now says invalid credentials when I click register, you then click login, it then logs in

* No option to cancel remote player, it just goes to continual loop. Might be better to have a cancel button

* Nickname notification. So if someone tries an already existing nickname, they are notified that they must choose another one
