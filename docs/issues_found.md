## ISSUES FOUND TODAY

* Auto login doesn't work. It now says invalid credentials when I click register, you then click login, it then logs in

* No option to cancel remote player if the option on homescreen is triggered, it just goes to continual loop. Might be better to have a cancel button

* Nickname notification. So if someone tries an already existing nickname, they are notified that they must choose another one

* Issues with logging out, seems like the logout button is not being triggered, therefore user would remain online and there seems to be a bug when I click the button. It hasn't done it everytime

* Need to update the chat-service(ONLY ASH) with new cleaned up version. Still using old version for now so theres not new bugs
