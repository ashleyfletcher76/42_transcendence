## API Documentation for User Service

## Summary:

The User Service is responsible for handling user-related data and functionality, such as registration and managing user profiles. The service manages the storage, retrieval, and modification of user information in a centralized manner. This service does not handle authentication but focuses on user details.

## HTTP Endpoints
1. User Registration

Description: Registers a new user in the system. This endpoint accepts user details and creates a new user entry in the database.


```plaintext
POST /users/register/
```

- Request Payload:

```plaintext
{
	"username": "newuser",
	"password": "newpassword123"
}
```

- Response:

```plaintext
{
	"message": "User created successfully"
}
```

- Error Response: If there are validation errors (e.g., the username already exists), you will receive a 400 Bad Request error:

json

```plaintext

  "username": [
    "This field must be unique."
  ]
}
```

2. User Profile

Description: Retrieves the profile of the currently authenticated user. This requires the user to be authenticated using a valid JWT.

}
```

- Error Response: If the user is not authenticated or the token is invalid, you will receive a 401 Unauthorized error:

```plaintext
{
	"detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."
}
```

3. Update User Profile

Description: Updates the userâ€™s profile information, such as their username or email. This endpoint also requires authentication.

```plaintext

```

```plaintext
{
	"username": "newusername",
	"email": "newemail@example.com"

```plaintext

	"detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."
}
```

## Error Codes

- 400 Bad Request: Validation errors, such as duplicate usernames or invalid field values.
- 401 Unauthorized: Missing or invalid JWT token.
- 404 Not Found: If attempting to access a user resource that does not exist.

## Summary for Frontend:

- User Registration: Use /users/register/ to create new users.
- Profile Management: Access user details using the /users/profile/ endpoint, which will return the user's current data. You can also update user information using the same route.
- Authentication Requirement: All requests, except for registration, require JWT tokens in the headers. Ensure the tokens are sent correctly in all authenticated requests.
